#' @param legend either a logical specifying not to plot a legend for this layer (FALSE) or a string indicating the name of the legend entry for this layer (note that when mapping plot attributes to variables in \code{data}, a legend is automatically created and does not need to be specified - see "Mapped plot attributes and legends" below)
#' @section Mapped plot attributes and legends: When specifying an input data frame for a layer through the \code{data} argument, columns of \code{data} can be used to specify various plot attributes such as \code{color}, etc. For example, with \code{ly_point(..., data = iris, color = Species)}, the \code{Species} variable is used to determine how to color the points.  Here, \code{Species} is "mapped" to the \code{color} attribute.  Both continuous and categorical variables can be mapped.  In the case of continuous variables, the range is cut into slices and attributes are applied to each interval.  The mapping from the values of the variable to the actual plot attributes is determined based on the theme.
