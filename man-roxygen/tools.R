#' @param fig figure to modify
#' @family tools
#' @note Tools can be easily specified as a vector of tool names in the \code{tools} argument when instantiating a \code{\link{figure}}.  In this case, they are added with defaults.  Explicitly calling these \code{tool_} functions will manually add the tool to a figure and allow additional specification of parameters.
